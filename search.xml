    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This article was written on February 4, 2018.Author: Charles Huang（小神童）Translation &amp; Recording: Lily Kidman（水天之间）The contents of this article are personal opinions and are for reference only. They don’t constitute any investment suggestions. var ap = new APlayer({ element: document.getElementById("aplayer-EhHgBFxb"), narrow: false, autoplay: false, showlrc: false, music: { title: "Purchase token boldly...", author: "Lily Kidman", url: "http://ok7yt1lk3.bkt.clouddn.com/2018-03-05.m4a", pic: "http://ok7yt1lk3.bkt.clouddn.com/65ab5cc711b54fed8dbb6a83e382ba27.jpg", lrc: "" } }); window.aplayers || (window.aplayers = []); window.aplayers.push(ap); Editorial from the ProdigyChina banned all the initial coin offerings and bitcoin exchanges from operating in the country on Sept.4th 2017, whereas Japan granted license to its domestic exchanges during the same period. This enabled the investors to thrive, but still post a rather high threshold for the numerous domestic investors. After a mix of tightening measures the government has taken to ban on cryptocurrency exchanges, it seemed this game has come to an end. Leaving the new players intimidated, and even some of the experienced players dumped their tokens and left the play-field. That explained why players celebrated after the major exchanges somehow found their way back to trading with CNY. Yet South Korea also contributed greatly in the token price surge, and without their craze, people is less likely to be attracted into the play field, and the price would not see such a soar. The channels into exchanges remain open, yet many a investor was already held-up under the ever tightening regulations across the globe as well as the falling prices. Those who have not invested are scared by the whining of the players thus not willing to step into the market. Basically now it is all about the inventory of your token, the major players will not give up taking advantage of this opportunity until they made enough money out of this situation. Some say the major players should look after the retail investors and show some mercy to them, otherwise they would all left and no more advantage can be taken from them. I want to emphasis, there are always new retail investors in the market. Those who run away from the market will run back again when they the market changes. If not, the price of cryptocurrency would not experience a 10-fold or even a 100-fold increase. So it’s needless to say when time comes to benefit from the retail investors, the major players would be nothing but ruthless. Yesterday’s price slump and today’s rebound seems like the strategy of carrot and stick, which certainly is just a torture. Given this situation, the market now is more suitable for short-term transaction and one should not get too engaged. Those who brought in at high price should consider this, if your bet is on the major currencies then it’s advised to stay put. Or be decisive to sell out if your previous investment is not a smart one. In this circumstance, should you want to invest, it’s recommended to set different purchase prices. The lower the price you set, the higher the quantity you set to buy in, which translated into bulk purchase during the sharp price drop and vice versa. Lastly, the surest bet in cryptocurrency investment, do not sell out until you make money out of it. Last but not the least, the so-called value investment is the same as having the patience to stay the course. How much you profit depends on how big your appetite truly is. There are many high grade projects which prices now are lower than their initial issuing stages. You can check up on that part, when it comes to the ability to double the prices, they exceed the leading cryptocurrencies. Please note there is a premise in these two situations, that is to invest on the high quality ones-the already well-recognized value tokens. Number of players in that is large and they are more likely to succeed. Suppose they all become worthless eventually, in a certain timeframe, say half a year, they will outlive others.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This article was written on January 26, 2018.Author: Charles Huang（小神童）Translation &amp; Recording: Lily Kidman（水天之间）The contents of this article are personal opinions and are for reference only. They don’t constitute any investment suggestions. var ap = new APlayer({ element: document.getElementById("aplayer-UwcQaNUz"), narrow: false, autoplay: false, showlrc: false, music: { title: "Ending for most...", author: "Lily Kidman", url: "http://ok7yt1lk3.bkt.clouddn.com/%E5%A4%A7%E5%A4%9A%E6%95%B0%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%93%E5%B1%80%EF%BC%9A%E4%B8%80%E7%95%AA%E4%BA%A4%E6%88%98%E3%80%81%E5%B8%9D%E7%8E%8B%E6%A2%A6%E7%A2%8E%EF%BC%8C%E8%A1%80%E6%B5%81%E6%88%90%E6%B2%B3.m4a", pic: "http://ok7yt1lk3.bkt.clouddn.com/65ab5cc711b54fed8dbb6a83e382ba27.jpg", lrc: "" } }); window.aplayers || (window.aplayers = []); window.aplayers.push(ap); Editorial from the ProdigyEnding for most: fierce fights saw the broken dreams and blood shed. The cryptocurrency world finds you just like a king, worrying about the ups and downs of the currencies. You stay fully awake at night, staring at the ceiling, not knowing which currencies out of the thousands would be the best choice for you just like you have difficulty picking out which beauty to bed. Those currencies/beauties are way too smart to hit your soft spots, seemingly trying to tackle your problems, fighting to win your heart over with all the tricks, yet their true target is your money. Once you can not resist the temptation, their time has come to exploit you hard. Most of the people ends like this, their dream as an emperor broke after the loss in fight and blood shed. Financial games have been cruel since the very beginning, however, there are times when even the dumb ones find it easy to make money, desperate to run into the play-field, and you should be cautious when that happens. A giant bubble always appears in time like these, while the bubble might just burst. It is supposed to be a time to retreat from a game yet many are attracted by the money effect, therefore promoted the bubble to its instant end. Leaving those new players nothing but sighing and wondering about whether it is good or bad luck for them? How come they experience such dramatic fluctuations shortly after they enter the play field? Is there any way to avoid this? There certainly is, and that is to remember that lagging behind leaves one vulnerable, whereas winners are those who run super fast. Keep an close eye on the big guns and follow their steps closely. When they race ahead, you do too. Suppose they start to converge gradually and change to a new frontier, you should follow suit. In no case should you hesitate or be reluctant to retreat; be decisive rather than reckless, otherwise it would be way too late as all the others also come around. Should it happens that you are a newbie who basically knows nothing and have no idea where the trend goes, then the first priority is to spend money in the game and gain some experiences to become the few senior players. All the commander in chief on the battlefield fight bravely, and became exceptional by the hard-learned lessons in the price of blood or even their life. Traders in cryptocurrency world are just the same, they have to assess the situation in the real battle, and select a path among the complex market. This is the reflection of one’s comprehensive caliber, which is based on his past experiences and hard-learnt lessons. Having said these much, still it is less impressive than had a serious illness; reading too much can not compete with the actual feeling of winning and losing in transactions. The long waited announcement finally came today, yet it reads no more the helplessness of the regulating party than charging holding cryptocurrency illegal. Nor does it regulate against transaction between individuals. In this circumstance, one can hold the currency and trade it freely, then the only concern shifts to how can one hoard more currencies. Be it bargain-hunting, selling out at high price then buying in at low price, or taking advantage of price differences between different platforms etc. Do you best to surprise me. It is noticeable that the announcement mentioned in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of our country, investors within the boarder might have difficulty visiting some websites or paying for their orders which could incur some losses. Therefore to reach out to the world behind the wall becomes a necessity, and you would certainly regret not having it done earlier when that day comes, so do it now. I am waiting for you at the Crazyblockchain’s Telegram, the address is: Telegram. It is not longer safe to use WeChat. The road to financial independence is right before you, so do not get scared by rumors. Cryptocurrency world cannot guarantee you a one hundred percent realization of financial freedom, yet it definitely is a shortcut, it all comes down to you strength and skills. Investment is a kind of discipline to some degree, the weaknesses of human nature would surface one after another. Those who hold the currency with dozens or even hundreds of floating profits are the ones of faith.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This article was written on January 22, 2018.Author: Charles Huang（小神童）Translation &amp; Recording: Lily Kidman（水天之间）The contents of this article are personal opinions and are for reference only.

However, you probably should take a look at this story. In January 2017, Amanda grabbed a 10CNY virtual red pocket from a digital tokens speculation group, then she changed that money into XRP (Ripple) at 0.02CNY/token, and received 200CNY after she sold them out at 0.4CNY. After that she took a purchase of NEM (New Economy Movement) and sold out at 0.9CNY, and received 4,000CNY out of it. She then brought in LTC (Litecoin) at 27CNY/token while getting 26,000CNY when she sold out at 180CNY. Before DOGE’s price plummeted, she sold out at 0.029 and got 520,000CNY. She spent them all on Bit-shares at 0.25 while profited 5,200,000CNY when sold at 3CNY. Followed by purchasing ETH (Ethereum) at 300 and her fortune rose to 30,000,000CNY after she sold at 2,300. She bravely invested all on ETC (Ethereum classic) before its price fell to almost 100CNY, and sold out at 400CNY, which made it effortless for her to reach the goal of earning 100,000,000CNY. Everyone wishes to buy in and sell out at the perfect time just like her, however, the probability of making profits with the least amount of money is extremely low. Those who prefer margin trading might find themselves at loss now. Never am I fond of it unless I know with absolute certainty, otherwise I will not take the risk. That is because I have seen many who have already suffered from it, winning the bet the first nine times and lost all in the tenth game thus brought an end to oneself. A quick question for the new investors who favor margin trading, suppose that you sell out at 250CNY, then the market fell to 251 after a surge in price. What is your next move? What if you don’t purchase and lose the opportunity to buy in at this price ever again? What if the price becomes lower after you choose to buy in, and what would you feel about it? You may find it almost impossible to answer this question in view of a changing market. The right thing to do when facing such an opportunity with huge potential, simply is to buy in, particularly when the price collapse. Most of the mass are incapable of mastering margin trading, also keep this in mind, do not waste a chance over just a few bucks, since in the long run, none of these matters. On the other hand, should the price slump, do not attempt to get in all at a time. It is suggested to build part of your position as no one knows for sure whether there is a even lower price for you to build position. When the time comes I do not have the money to build position, someone said to me. Truth be told, if you spend 2,000CNY on the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on a monthly basis, you probably will wait until forever to actually make some money out of it. For those with less capital in hand, there is another way for you to play, and that is to fight your way into the market and try to make as much seed money as you possibly can. Given that the amount of principal is low, you can always finance some more in case of a hold up. In the cryptocurrency world, it all comes down to the information you could receive and the analysis of it. Therefore exert your best efforts to seek and select the information, then make the best use of it to make some breakthroughs. Do not be greedy. Suppose you do are not able to do so and lack the perseverance, it’s best for you to just get some pocket money buying the popular currencies. Earnings out of this would far exceed savings from bank deposits. Currency trading is all about buying and selling, and these two words reveals your true personality. To trade currency to is to reap from others’ cognitive bias. The year of 2018 will witness the outburst in this regard, so better equip yourself with the necessary skills to truly grasp this unprecedented and once in a life opportunity. At the same time, benefit from the fluctuating cryptocurrency world. Speaking of which, I have to advise the book from ours, once you read it you will realize that, you were not able to gain from others’ cognitive bias only because your have not read RenZhiTuWei-from Cai Leilei.]]></content>

codepoints) &#123; codepoints = codepoints.map(function (code) &#123; return '&amp;#x' + code + ';' &#125;).join('') return '&lt;span id="' + options.idName + '" ' + styles +- ' title="' + emojiName +- '" data-src="' + emojis[emojiName].src ++ ' data-src="' + emojis[emojiName].src + '"&gt;' + codepoints + '&lt;/span&gt;' &#125; else &#123; return '&lt;img id="' + options.idName + '" ' + styles +- ' title="' + emojiName + '" alt="' + emojiName + '" src="' ++ ' alt="' + emojiName + '" src="' + emojis[emojiName].src + '" height="20" width="20" /&gt;' &#125; 由于 NexT 主题的相关样式会干扰 emoji 图片的显示效果，所以要在custom.styl中加代码： 文件位置：~/blog/themes/next/source/css/_custom/custom.styl123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354555657585960// 自定义emoji样式img#github-emoji &#123;

color: #222 !important;&#125; 然后直接去 Emoji Cheat Sheet 点一下自己想要的表情复制，再粘贴到自己的文章中即可～ 而且用途不止于 emoji，手机里的各种表情包，传到自己的云存储，然后按照插件 README 中的写法： 1&lt;img id="github-emoji" src="https://表情包.gif" height="30" width="30" /&gt; 改下 URL，看情况改下 height 和 width 的值即可啦，GIF 也可以哦～ 当然，还有萌即正义的 颜文字 (ﾉ*･ω･)ﾉ～ 问 答 调用的是哪里的 emoji 图片？ 由这个插件的 README 可知，调用 Github 的 API ，写法也是按照 Github 的～ 为什么要将插件源码里的class改为id？ 按下 F12 可看到，开启 fancyBox 后，会为默认的图片标签（img）加上一个.fancybox的class，里面有一个样式：display: block !important;，因为我们要让 emoji 显示在文字之间（display: inline;），但是由于默认的class已经加了!important，所以必须用样式规则的应用优先权高于class的id。 为什么要删除插件源码里的title？ 因为图片有title后，NexT 会将它显示在图片下方，显然不满足 emoji 的显示要求。 为什么要修改.post-body a的样式？ 因为 NexT 会将图片标签包裹在一个a标签内，而a标签是有下划线的，emoji 下面竟然有根线？显然不满足要求。 插入音乐和视频音乐可以直接用 HTML 的标签，写法如下： &lt;audio src=&quot;https://什么什么什么.mp3&quot; style=&quot;max-height :100%; max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; preload=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Your browser does not support the audio tag.&lt;/audio&gt; 用插件，有显示歌词功能，也美观，建议使用这种方法。 首先在站点文件夹根目录安装插件： 1npm install hexo-tag-aplayer --save 然后文章中的写法： 1&#123;% aplayer "歌曲名" "歌手名" "https://什么什么什么.mp3" "https://封面图.jpg" "lrc:https://歌词.lrc" %&#125; 单独一首歌，showlrc的默认值为2，由这里可知，值为2时会通过JS调用歌词文件，并直接将歌词写入页面的 HTML 代码中，所以请保持网络通畅。 另外可以支持歌单： 1234567891011121314151617181920212223&#123;% aplayerlist %&#125;&#123; "autoplay": false, "showlrc": 3, "mutex": true, "music": [ &#123; "title": "歌曲名", "author": "歌手名", "url": "https://什么什么什么.mp3", "pic": "https://封面图.jpg", "lrc": "https://歌词.lrc" &#125;, &#123; "title": "歌曲名", "author": "歌手名", "url": "https://什么什么什么.mp3", "pic": "https://封面图.jpg", "lrc": "https://歌词.lrc" &#125; ]&#125;&#123;% endaplayerlist %&#125; 详细参数见README和这插件的“母亲”Aplayer 的 官方文档。 关于lrc歌词，可以用工具下载网易云音乐的歌词，另发现暂时不支持offset参数。目前我用的这个工具lrc歌词编辑器 什么，你想把网易云的几百首歌手动同步到博客？！慢慢慢，有一种非常简单的方法 视频&lt;video poster=&quot;https://封面图.jpg&quot; src=&quot;https://什么什么什么.mp4&quot; style=&quot;max-height :100%; max-width: 100%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;&quot; controls=&quot;controls&quot; loop=&quot;loop&quot; preload=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;Your browser does not support the video tag.&lt;/video&gt; 用插件，功能更加强大，比如可以弹幕，非常建议使用。 首先在站点文件夹根目录安装插件： 1npm install hexo-tag-dplayer --save 然后文章中的写法： {% dplayer "url=https://什么什么什么.mp4" "https://封面图.jpg" "api=https://api.prprpr.me/dplayer/" "id=" "loop=false" %} 要使用弹幕，必须有api和id两项，并且若使用的是官方的 api 地址（即上面的），id 的值不能与一个列表的值一样。id 的值自己随便取，唯一要求就是前面这点。 如果唯一要求难倒了你，可以使用这个工具将一段与众不同的文字生成一段看起来毫无意义的哈希值，这样看起来是不是好多了。 视频插件在 NexT 主题下有 bug！页面全屏有问题，issue 页面 ，可以通过在custom.styl中加代码解决。或者在主题配置文件中关闭motion。 // 修视频播放器dplayer页面全屏的bug .use-motion .post-body { transform: inherit !important;
