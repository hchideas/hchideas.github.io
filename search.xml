href="https://coinshen.com/2018/04/01-xiaoshentong.html#如何投资-Endorsit（赞我）">传送门</a>👈到达下一站;<br><br>如果你对比特币还很陌生，对区块链以及区块链项目肯定也不甚了解，就接着往下看^_^</p></div><p><strong>比特币</strong> 🤔</p><p>简单来说，比特币就是游戏中的游戏币，区块链项目就相当于游戏厅，区块链呢就像链条一样，一环扣一环，只不过区块链的<code>链</code>由<code>数据</code>组成。</p><p>打开支付宝点开账单，你会看到所有历史记录，每一天的记录就相当于一个打包的<code>区块</code>，将每一天的记录挨个串联<code>链</code>起来，就是你的支付宝历史账单，即<code>区块链</code>。</p><blockquote class="blockquote-center"><p>账簿——区块链<br>支付宝——区块链项目<br>支付宝公司股票——比特币</p></blockquote><p>比特币是目前最成功的区块链项目，比特币其实相当于该项目的<span class="label danger">股票</span>，当你购买 100 美金比特币，就相当于持有了该项目的股份，项目发展越好“股票”价格自然也就越高。</p><p><strong>为何区块链这么火爆</strong> 🤔</p><p>区块链技术实际上就是公开透明地分布式数据库，何为分布式，就是分布在世界各地的人都可以参与记账。</p><p>在互联网时代，每个系统背后都有数据库，你的购物习惯、隐私、行为特点、输入法输入的文字等等，都被中心化的系统管理人员记在数据库中，然后可以大数据杀熟，精准投放广告，出卖你的隐私，封王五四的号等等。</p><p>百度、腾讯、阿里、Facebook 等等公司掌握着巨量用户数据，并且还在通过各种方法不断获取用户数据，这些数据我们都看不到，自然也不能拿过来用。</p><p>区块链技术形成的数据库，打破了中心化巨头的统治地位，人人都可以上去记账，并且账本不掌握在任何一家公司手里，任何人都可以使用，不过要注意的是，你要是想记假账，其他人不同意你就记不上去，换句话说，每个人都有一本一模一样地账本，你的账本即使弄丢了也不影响，但如果你的账本跟其他人不一样，想成功记上这笔账，唯一的办法是把所有人的账本都改掉，而这几乎是不可能事件。<br>比如腾讯见到王五四的文章必封，这对于数据掌握者腾讯来说轻而易举，但要是全国的人都复制王五四的文章到各个平台发送，想干掉就不容易了。</p><p>记账是一项浩大的工程，不能白白记账（复制王五四的文章到处发），拿比特币来说，当你成功在比特币区块链上记账，就会收到系统奖励的比特币，相当于你直接获得了这个项目的<span class="label danger">股票</span>，所以很多人以记账获取比特币为生，少部分人因此成为了亿万富豪，这种诱惑力可以说非常之大，传统领域根本没有这样的诱惑力，你不可能通过为项目做贡献就轻易获得股份，也无法享受项目发展带来的红利。</p><p>区块链项目不以公司为主体，而是以社区为主体。与中心化机构不同的是，这是一个开放的社区，任何志同道合的人，比如开发者、投资者、创业者等等包括普通个人或者机构，为了实现共同的目标，都可以加入这个社区贡献自己的力量，在这里，每个人都可以找到适合自己的位置，获得相应的酬劳。</p><p><strong>区块链是一条利益链，把所有人绑在一起，同甘共苦。</strong></p><p>区块链这么火，不仅在于技术本身的优势，更在于技术本身利用人性的贪婪来完成。</p><p><strong>区块链对我们有何用</strong> 🤔</p><blockquote><p>根据中国工业与信息化部发布的《中国区块链技术和应用发展白皮书2016》，区块链的应用已延伸到医疗健康、教育、慈善公益、社会管理等多个领域。拿文化产业来看，复制成本低、维权成本高、举证困难等使得知识产权保护一直是行业痛点。有了区块链，文化产品的生产、传播、交易等记录真实透明、可信可查，问题迎刃而解。</p></blockquote><p>很多人说区块链转账不仅复杂，手续费还高，认为它没有传统领域的工具好用，不会改变人们的生活，但你可能没有意识到，改变总在不经意间发生，就像互联网多了移动变成移动互联网，多年后就诞生了饿了么、滴滴打车等产品，在这些产品没有做出来之前，也很难想象竟然足不出户就可以吃到想吃的美食，随时拿起手机就可以便捷地出行，如果现在没了滴滴打车、饿了么，你会不会觉得生活艰辛了很多？</p><p>技术进步几乎都是改善生产力，而区块链技术的出现，本质上是改善了生产关系，颠覆社会运行模式也不是不可能。</p><p>区块链从一开始就把从业者、投资人、用户的关系三位一体化，换而言之就是<span class="label danger">全民皆兵</span>，把能参加战斗的人都聚集在同一个社区，随时准备为社区贡献自己的力量，并且还能获得不可估算的回报，可大可小，凭借能力来定。</p><p>今天，区块链行业还处于早期阶段，进军区块链领域的团队都在不断摸索和实践，都是未来世界的开拓者，如果你能参与区块链项目，当好“全民皆兵”中的<code>兵</code>，当该领域的势能积累到一个临界点时，区块链世界就会爆发，你也会自然而然享受到更多利益。</p><p>进入区块链行业的门槛高吗？其实一点也不高，来<code>赞我</code>发表一条动态，就已经参与进来了。</p><h1

This enabled the investors to thrive, but still post a rather high threshold for the numerous domestic investors.</p><p>After a mix of tightening measures the government has taken to ban on cryptocurrency exchanges, it seemed this game has come to an end. Leaving the new players intimidated, and even some of the experienced players dumped their tokens and left the play-field.</p><p>That explained why players celebrated after the major exchanges somehow found their way back to trading with CNY. Yet South Korea also contributed greatly in the token price surge, and without their craze, people is less likely to be attracted into the play field, and the price would not see such a soar.</p><p>The channels into exchanges remain open, yet many a investor was already held-up under the ever tightening regulations across the globe as well as the falling prices. Those who have not invested are scared by the whining of the players thus not willing to step into the market. Basically now it is all about the inventory of your token, the major players will not give up taking advantage of this opportunity until they made enough money out of this situation.</p><p>Some say the major players should look after the retail investors and show some mercy to them, otherwise they would all left and no more advantage can be taken from them. I want to emphasis, there are always new retail investors in the market. Those who run away from the market will run back again when they the market changes. If not, the price of cryptocurrency would not experience a 10-fold or even a 100-fold increase. So it’s needless to say when time comes to benefit from the retail investors, the major players would be nothing but ruthless.</p><p><strong>Yesterday’s price slump and today’s rebound seems like the strategy of carrot and stick, which certainly is just a torture.</strong></p><p>Given this situation, the market now is more suitable for short-term transaction and one should not get too engaged. Those who brought in at high price should consider this, if your bet is on the major currencies then it’s advised to stay put. Or be decisive to sell out if your previous investment is not a smart one. In this circumstance, should you want to invest, it’s recommended to set different purchase prices. The lower the price you set, the higher the quantity you set to buy in, which translated into bulk purchase during the sharp price drop and vice versa.</p><p>Lastly, the surest bet in cryptocurrency investment, do not sell out until you make money out of it.</p><p>Last but not the least, the so-called value investment is the same as having the patience to stay the course. How much you profit depends on how big your appetite truly is. There are many high grade projects which prices now are lower than their initial issuing stages. You can check up on that part, when it comes to the ability to double the prices, they exceed the leading cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Please note there is a premise in these two situations, that is to invest on the high quality ones-the already well-recognized value tokens. Number of players in that is large and they are more likely to succeed. Suppose they all become worthless eventually, in a certain timeframe, say half a year, they will outlive others.</p>]]></content>

You stay fully awake at night, staring at the ceiling, not knowing which currencies out of the thousands would be the best choice for you just like you have difficulty picking out which beauty to bed.</p><p>Those currencies/beauties are way too smart to hit your soft spots, seemingly trying to tackle your problems, fighting to win your heart over with all the tricks, yet their true target is your money. Once you can not resist the temptation, their time has come to exploit you hard.</p><p><strong>Most of the people ends like this, their dream as an emperor broke after the loss in fight and blood shed.</strong> </p><p>Financial games have been cruel since the very beginning, however, there are times when even the dumb ones find it easy to make money, desperate to run into the play-field, and you should be cautious when that happens. A giant bubble always appears in time like these, while the bubble might just burst. It is supposed to be a time to retreat from a game yet many are attracted by the money effect, therefore promoted the bubble to its instant end. Leaving those new players nothing but sighing and wondering about whether it is good or bad luck for them? How come they experience such dramatic fluctuations shortly after they enter the play field?</p><p>Is there any way to avoid this?</p><p>There certainly is, and that is to remember that lagging behind leaves one vulnerable, whereas winners are those who run super fast.</p><p>Keep an close eye on the big guns and follow their steps closely. When they race ahead, you do too. Suppose they start to converge gradually and change to a new frontier, you should follow suit. In no case should you hesitate or be reluctant to retreat; be decisive rather than reckless, otherwise it would be way too late as all the others also come around.</p><p>Should it happens that you are a newbie who basically knows nothing and have no idea where the trend goes, then the first priority is to spend money in the game and gain some experiences to become the few senior players. All the commander in chief on the battlefield fight bravely, and became exceptional by the hard-learned lessons in the price of blood or even their life. Traders in cryptocurrency world are just the same, they have to assess the situation in the real battle, and select a path among the complex market. This is the reflection of one’s comprehensive caliber, which is based on his past experiences and hard-learnt lessons.</p><p><strong>Having said these much, still it is less impressive than had a serious illness; reading too much can not compete with the actual feeling of winning and losing in transactions.</strong></p><p>The long waited announcement finally came today, yet it reads no more the helplessness of the regulating party than charging holding cryptocurrency illegal. Nor does it regulate against transaction between individuals. In this circumstance, one can hold the currency and trade it freely, then the only concern shifts to how can one hoard more currencies. Be it bargain-hunting, selling out at high price then buying in at low price, or taking advantage of price differences between different platforms etc. Do you best to surprise me.</p><p><img src="http://ok7yt1lk3.bkt.clouddn.com/e2d4efdb0778747996319cc99ac663dc.jpg" alt="The announcement above was issued by the government on Jan.26th, 2018."></p><p>It is noticeable that the announcement mentioned in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of our country, investors within the boarder might have difficulty visiting some websites or paying for their orders which could incur some losses. Therefore to reach out to the world behind the wall becomes a necessity, and you would certainly regret not having it done earlier when that day comes, so do it now.

It is not longer safe to use WeChat.</p><p>The road to financial independence is right before you, so do not get scared by rumors. Cryptocurrency world cannot guarantee you a one hundred percent realization of financial freedom, yet it definitely is a shortcut, it all comes down to you strength and skills.</p><p>Investment is a kind of discipline to some degree, the weaknesses of human nature would surface one after another.

After that she took a purchase of NEM (New Economy Movement) and sold out at 0.9CNY, and received 4,000CNY out of it. She then brought in LTC (Litecoin) at 27CNY/token while getting 26,000CNY when she sold out at 180CNY. Before DOGE’s price plummeted, she sold out at 0.029 and got 520,000CNY. She spent them all on Bit-shares at 0.25 while profited 5,200,000CNY when sold at 3CNY. Followed by purchasing ETH (Ethereum) at 300 and her fortune rose to 30,000,000CNY after she sold at 2,300. She bravely invested all on ETC (Ethereum classic) before its price fell to almost 100CNY, and sold out at 400CNY, which made it effortless for her to reach the goal of earning 100,000,000CNY.</p><p>Everyone wishes to buy in and sell out at the perfect time just like her, however, the probability of making profits with the least amount of money is extremely low.</p><p>Those who prefer margin trading might find themselves at loss now. Never am I fond of it unless I know with absolute certainty, otherwise I will not take the risk. That is because I have seen many who have already suffered from it, winning the bet the first nine times and lost all in the tenth game thus brought an end to oneself.</p><p>A quick question for the new investors who favor margin trading, suppose that you sell out at 250CNY, then the market fell to 251 after a surge in price. What is your next move? What if you don’t purchase and lose the opportunity to buy in at this price ever again? What if the price becomes lower after you choose to buy in, and what would you feel about it?</p><p>You may find it almost impossible to answer this question in view of a changing market. The right thing to do when facing such an opportunity with huge potential, simply is to buy in, particularly when the price collapse. Most of the mass are incapable of mastering margin trading, also keep this in mind, do not waste a chance over just a few bucks, since in the long run, none of these matters. On the other hand, should the price slump, do not attempt to get in all at a time. It is suggested to build part of your position as no one knows for sure whether there is a even lower price for you to build position.</p><p>When the time comes I do not have the money to build position, someone said to me. Truth be told, if you spend 2,000CNY on the major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin on a monthly basis, you probably will wait until forever to actually make some money out of it. For those with less capital in hand, there is another way for you to play, and that is to fight your way into the market and try to make as much seed money as you possibly can. Given that the amount of principal is low, you can always finance some more in case of a hold up. In the cryptocurrency world, it all comes down to the information you could receive and the analysis of it. Therefore exert your best efforts to seek and select the information, then make the best use of it to make some breakthroughs. Do not be greedy.</p><p>Suppose you do are not able to do so and lack the perseverance, it’s best for you to just get some pocket money buying the popular currencies. Earnings out of this would far exceed savings from bank deposits.</p><p>Currency trading is all about buying and selling, and these two words reveals your true personality. To trade currency to is to reap from others’ cognitive bias. The year of 2018 will witness the outburst in this regard, so better equip yourself with the necessary skills to truly grasp this unprecedented and once in a life opportunity. At the same time, benefit from the fluctuating cryptocurrency world.  Speaking of which, I have to advise the book from ours, once you read it you will realize that, you were not able to gain from others’ cognitive bias only because your have not read <em>RenZhiTuWei</em>-from Cai Leilei. </p>]]></content>
